TaskManager
===========

This is a very basic task manager / to-do list type thing. Nothing crazy to it, just add a task, edit a task, complete a task, and delete a task. When you select the checkbox to complete the task, it will move to the "Completed Task" section and have a line going through the text label (strike-through), but the task will still be editable if you choose to press "Edit" while it is under the completed section, and you can click the checkbox again to bring the task back into the main "To Do" section. Obviously, the tasks can be deleted in any state.

This is a small little thing I made when messing around with JavaScript, and there isn't anything spectacular to it...
